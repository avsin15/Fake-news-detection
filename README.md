# 🧠 AI Fact-Check & News Verification Dashboard (2025)

### 📊 A Hybrid LLM + ML Powered Fake News Detection & Evidence Analysis System

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **AI Fact-Check Dashboard** is a next-generation data analytics project designed to automatically **verify the truthfulness of news claims, articles, and URLs** using a combination of:

- **Google Gemini 1.5 / 2.0 Pro (via Vertex API)**  
- **OpenAI GPT-5 reasoning model**  
- **Custom Machine Learning classifier (XGBoost / Logistic Regression hybrid)**  
- **Real-time evidence retrieval via Google Custom Search, NewsAPI, and GNews**  

The system serves as a **research-grade capstone project for Data Analysts** exploring hybrid AI–ML systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and media verification pipelines.

## 🧩 Core Features

✅ **LLM + ML Hybrid Reasoning**  
> Combines Gemini’s structured analysis and GPT-5’s logical reasoning with a machine learning truth score trained on recent news datasets.

✅ **Real-Time Evidence Retrieval**  
> Integrates Google Custom Search, GNews, and RSS pipelines to fetch live, verifiable sources supporting or refuting the input claim.

✅ **Automatic Claim Type Routing**  
> Detects whether the input is historical (Gemini), recent (GPT-5), or predictive (ML model fallback).

✅ **Dual Verdict Logic**  
> Provides both a *reasoned verdict* (LLM) and a *numerical truth score* (ML model) with visual indicators.

✅ **Dynamic Dashboard (Streamlit)**  
> Beautifully designed Streamlit UI for interactive exploration of claims, verdicts, evidence, and analytics.

✅ **Explainable Results**  
> Every result includes:  
> - ✅ Verdict  
> - 💬 Reasoning  
> - 🔍 Evidence sources  
> - 📈 Truth score
